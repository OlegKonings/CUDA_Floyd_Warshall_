Success! The GPU Floyd-Warshall result and the CPU Floyd-Warshall results are identical(both final adjacency matrix and path matrix).

N= 6000 , and the total number of elements(for Adjacency Matrix and Path Matrix) was 36000000 .
Matrices are int full dense format(row major) with a minimum of 9000000 valid directed edges.

The CPU timing for all was 821.357 seconds, and the GPU timing(including all device memory operations(allocations,copies etc) ) for all was 61.044 seconds.
The GPU result was 13.4552 faster than the CPU version.
