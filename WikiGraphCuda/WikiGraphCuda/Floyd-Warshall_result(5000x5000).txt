Success! The GPU Floyd-Warshall result and the CPU Floyd-Warshall results are identical(both final adjacency matrix and path matrix).

N= 5000 , and the total number of elements(for Adjacency Matrix and Path Matrix) was 25000000 .
Matrices are int full dense format(row major) with a minimum of 6250000 valid directed edges.

The CPU timing for all was 476.51 seconds, and the GPU timing(including all device memory operations(allocations,copies etc) ) for all was 35.691 seconds.
The GPU result was 13.351 faster than the CPU version.
